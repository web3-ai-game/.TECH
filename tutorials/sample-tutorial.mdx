# Welcome to Your First Tutorial

This is an example of how you can write your course content using MDX. You can use standard Markdown syntax and even embed React components.

## Code Blocks

Here is an example of a JavaScript code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// This is a comment
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

You can write detailed explanations and provide clear, readable code examples to your students.
